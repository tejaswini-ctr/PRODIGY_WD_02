The GitHub repository sample-login-signup-form by ritwickdey provides a basic example of a login and signup form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The README.md file does not contain any specific information about the project, but the code in the repository includes a simple form with input fields for username and password, and a submit button. The form is styled using CSS, and there is no backend implementation for handling form submissions.
